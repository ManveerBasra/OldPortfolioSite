### About This Project

This was one of my first experiences working with HTML and CSS. I created the website from scratch with Material Design in mind, and payed close attention to front-end and responsive design.

When designing the website, I drew inspiration from [Brian Atiyeh's Site](http://brianatiyeh.com/).
